Introduction
This project implements various tree traversals and functions to check if given nodes are cousins or not in a binary tree. In addition to it we also provide different function to check whether or not two nodes are siblings. The code provides both recursive and non-recursive implementations of the following tree traversals:
*    Pre-order
*    In-order
*    Post-order
*    Level-order 
Usage
To use the code, the user must define a binary tree and call the relevant function for each tree traversal or cousin check. The code includes examples of how to create a binary tree and call the functions.
Function Details 
   Tree Traversals :
*preOrder(root) - Pre-order traversal of binary tree using recursion.
*preOrdernr(root) - Pre-order traversal of binary tree without using recursion.
*inOorder(root) - In-order traversal of binary tree using recursion.
*inOrdernr(root) - In-order traversal of binary tree without using recursion.
*postOrder(root) - Post-order traversal of binary tree using recursion.
*postOrdernr(root) - Post-order traversal of binary tree without using recursion.
*depth(root) - Level-order (Breadth-first search) traversal of binary tree.
 Cousin Check :-
      isCousin(root, a, b) - Check if the given nodes are cousins or not in the binary tree.
 Siblings Check :-
      isSiblings(root, a, b) - Check if the given nodes are siblings or not in the binary tree.
Conclusion
The code in this project demonstrates various methods to traverse a binary tree and check if given nodes are cousins or not. The code can be used as a reference or starting point for further development.
